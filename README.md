How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I believe that user needs should be interpreted using a significant amount of user feedback. This is where user stories come into play. User stories help give a framework of what it is the user is wanting to get out and see within the product. I can then take these stories and elaborate on them and ask for further clarification where needed. Using these I can then send it to tester to interprest into test cases that will eventually be used to help create the final program. 

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

There are several methods that can be used to developing programs. Some are the waterfall and the agile process. I personally perfer the agile process. I will be implementing the consistant review and feedback into my processes becuase I find it more efficient. It helps catch errors sooner and prevents entire blocks of code from having to be comepletly redone. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Some of the qualities that I think good team members should have is relibility, punctuality, and communication. I want people on my team that are reliable and are able to get the job done. I want people who are on time and are able to make deadline. Lastly, I want someone that will have constant communocation for seveal things such as things that are completed, things that are being worked on, and if there are any problems.
